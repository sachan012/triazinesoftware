From day-to-day commute to groceries, our lives revolve around different apps. Enterprises and startups are investing a huge chunk of their marketing budget on developing apps to reach their audiences beyond geographical boundaries. Every day hundreds and thousands of apps are getting developed and pushed in the app stores. In fact, Statista says by 2020 mobile apps are expected to generate USD1888.9 billion. Having a mobile app for your business is no more a luxury, but a necessity if you wish to survive in this competitive marketplace. If you&rsquo;re looking to get an app developed for your business, then you need to know the current trends that are bringing in disruptions in the mobile app technology. Knowing them and implementing them in your app would certainly give you an edge over your competitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"5 mobile app development trends\" src=\"https://www.triazinesoft.com/admin/assets/images/postsDesc/5_trends.png\" style=\"height:430px; width:870px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5 mobile app development trends that you cannot miss</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><big>1. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence:</big></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Machine learning and AI has made their foray across industries and mobile app technology is not left behind. We will see more and more integration of ML and AI in the form of chatbots and visual assistant in the mobile apps in the coming days. In fact, the success of SIRI reaffirms the fact that ML and AI are going to stay and rule here for some time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><big>2. UI design to watch out for:</big></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Face ID to unlock your app device is definitely going to fetch you some brownie points for your app. Spare your users from remembering app passwords by integrating Face ID. Users&rsquo; attention span is decreasing and it is important to keep them hooked on to make your app a success. Incorporate motions and animations to engage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><big>3. Enterprise app trends:</big></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With enterprises leveraging the benefits of mobile apps, security is becoming a prime area of concern. Mobile app development companies are now addressing various concerns like possible hacking, data theft, and more. With enterprise apps becoming more imperative, app development companies are focusing on integrating valuable features to automate business workflows, support industry projects, enable frameworks for IoT and other advanced technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><big>4. On &ndash; Demand app:</big></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a report published by PwC, on-demand apps revenue will hit $335 billion by 2025. We are already witnessing some of them which are disrupting digitization. From on-demand groceries to on-demand cabs, on-demand apps are already an integral part of our lives. The benefits are many: They are accurate, convenient, nearest service availability, easy payment options available, and of course give us cost advantage. It has gained quite an attention of investors and will be on trend for the coming few years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><big>5. 5G technology for mobile app developers:</big></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a startup considering to get an app developed for your business, or if you are an app developer, give serious consideration about 5G technology for your app with respect to data security, augmented reality, 3D gaming, etc. Integrating custom made network slices along with ultra-low network latency will give your app an edge on its performance and responsiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Staying on top of the game is important given that a new app is getting pushed to the play store every minute. These are some of the top mobile app development trends to watch out for if you want your app to outshine others. However, it might be difficult for you to gauge which one would help in your business. In that case, leverage our industry experts to consult and get your app developed that will not only be trending in the app store but will be a trendsetter!&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 1, NULL, '5 trends that will be influencing mobile app development in 2019', '5 Trends: Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, UI design and development, Enterprise app trends, On – Demand apps, 5G technology for mobile app developers and many more.', 'Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence,UI design,Enterprise app trends,Enterprise app', 'uiux/5-trends-that-will-be-influencing-mobile-app-development-in-2019', '2019-06-11 04:47:12'),

Native Mobile App… Am I Making A Right Choice?', 'hybrid-mobile-app-vs-native-mobile-app-am-i-making-a-right-choice', 1, 12, 'article2.png', 'hybrid-native1.png', '<p>This seems to be <strong>a million-dollar question when it comes for making a choice between hybrid mobile app or native mobile app development</strong>.&nbsp; I have been hearing this question not only from my prospects but from existing customers as well each time either we start a new mobile project or engage for the first time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on my experience and interactions with customers,&nbsp; I strongly observed that this is <strong>one of the biggest bottlenecks that customers struggle with</strong> and for that matter even app developers for convincing customers and helping and guiding them making a right choice as per their business need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Trust me, there is no definite answer to this question and it cannot be as it has many aspects that must be explored in detail before making a final choice.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering all these, I am highlighting pros and cons of Hybrid and Native mobile app development approaches that you should take in account for developing mobile app that not only fulfills customer need but keeps all the stakeholders on a same page without any surprises with the outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let us first understand both the approaches for better clarity. However, for app users it doesn&#39;t matter the underlying technology the app is developed on.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is Native App?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Native mobile app is <strong>developed using platform-specific programming language and designed to run on a specific mobile operating system.</strong> For example, Java is used for Android app development and Objective-C or Swift is used for iPhone app development for iOS mobile operating system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the native apps are developed using mobile OS-specific languages, they <em>closely follow the technical and user experience guidelines and standard laid down by mobile operating system manufacturers. </em>These apps take significant advantage of being able to easily access device hardware and utilize capability of user&rsquo;s devices such as camera, GPS, contact etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Native App Development\" src=\"https://www.triazinesoft.com/admin/assets/images/postsDesc/Native_prosCons.png\" style=\"height:431px; width:870px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Pros and Cons of Native App Development</h3>\r\n\r\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width:100%\">\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th scope=\"col\"><strong>Pros</strong></th>\r\n			<th scope=\"col\"><strong>Cons</strong></th>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</thead>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Fast&nbsp; Performance</td>\r\n			<td>High Cost</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>seamless User Experience</td>\r\n			<td>Complex Code</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Easy utilization of native features</td>\r\n			<td>Separate Code base for iOS &amp; Android</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Native Technology Stack:</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Objective-C/Swift for iOS</li>\r\n	<li>Java for Android</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is Hybrid App?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Code Once and Run Everywhere&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>is the idea behind hybrid mobile app development.&nbsp; Hybrid app is <strong>essentially a web app which runs in mobile browser wrapped in a native container. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hybrid apps are designed to run on all mobile operating system with minimal or no tweaks. HTML5, CSS3 along with native plugins are at the core of hybrid mobile app development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Hybrid App Development\" src=\"https://www.triazinesoft.com/admin/assets/images/postsDesc/Hybrid_prosNcons.png\" style=\"height:431px; width:870px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Pros and Cons of <strong><a href=\"https://triazinesoft.com/hybrid-app-development.html\">Hybrid App Development</a></strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width:100%\">\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th scope=\"col\"><strong>Pros</strong></th>\r\n			<th scope=\"col\"><strong>Cons</strong></th>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</thead>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Saves Time - Faster App Development</td>\r\n			<td>Dependency on native plugins</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Saves Money - Less App development Cost</td>\r\n			<td>Dependency upon device mobile browser web kit for rendering app pages</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Single Code Base - Easy to maintain</td>\r\n			<td>Supporting multiple screen resolutions</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hybrid Technology Stack</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ionic</li>\r\n	<li>React Native</li>\r\n	<li>Flutter</li>\r\n	<li>Xamarin</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Basic guidelines choosing between native and hybrid mobile app development</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In my opinion, apply 70-30 thumb rule. If 70% features of the app use device hardware and native device features, I recommend following &ldquo;Native App Development Approach&rdquo; otherwise most of your app requirements can be developed following &ldquo;<a href=\"https://triazinesoft.com/hybrid-app-development.html\">Hybrid App Development</a> Approach&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Factors to be considered for making a choice</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Time to Market</li>\r\n	<li>App Development Cost</li>\r\n	<li>Code Maintainability</li>\r\n	<li>Performance</li>\r\n	<li>App Features (use of device hardware and native device feature)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>On a high-level, please may want to follow the guidelines below to choose your app development approach:</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Intensive use of device hardware and native device features like Camera Customization, GPS, Bluetooth, Printing Devices etc. makes a right candidate for &quot;Native App Development&quot; as this eliminates dependency upon native plug-ins.</li>\r\n	<li>Media rich apps like gaming apps, rich animated apps are best suited for &quot;Native App Development.</li>\r\n	<li>If you want to give best of user experience to your users and relies heavily on user interaction, then go for &quot;Native App Development&quot;.</li>\r\n	<li>For Startups, go for Hybrid App Development because making the world realize that your idea works much more important than anything else unless your app features fall in 70-30 criteria as mentioned above.</li>\r\n	<li>If you are targeting multiple platforms in shorter span of time and bit tight on your budget, go for Hybrid App Development.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conclusion...Just an opinion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no denying that native apps have edge in terms of performance, scalability etc. But, now a days, next-generation hybrid apps are not lagging far behind and the credit goes to the emerging latest hybrid platforms and growing hybrid community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Latest hybrid platforms such as IONIC, AngularJS, React, Flutter provides close native look and feel and improved performance if designed and developed intelligently considering technology boundaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the above facts and figures, I believe it is quite clear that there is no clear winner and it is debatable as well as both the approaches have pros &amp; cons. The choice between hybrid and native approaches is purely based on your business need and scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I strongly suggest having a Decision Analysis &amp; Resolution (DAR Analysis) to determine a recommended approach.</p>\r\n', 1, NULL, 'Hybrid Mobile App Vs.

Moreover, they accomplish all their work remotely.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also means you&rsquo;ll have to provide all the confidential information to a person working virtually.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And they might work on several different projects simultaneously. But there is no way to know if they prioritize your project. Multiple project collaborations might work in favour of the freelancers, but it does affect your project timeline, quality of work, and they might even cancel it if they find it less profitable than the others.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Advantages of hiring freelancers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It makes sense to review the advantages of hiring freelance developers over software development companies. It details cost-efficiency, flexibility, speed, etc.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reduced costs:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Probably one of the biggest reasons why any company would invest in freelancers: reduced investment. They ask for less money for their services than their counterparts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So many to choose from:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The freelancer market booms mainly because freelancers like making some side money. Then there are high-end freelancing websites like Upwork, Freelancer, Hubstaff Talent, etc. You&rsquo;re overwhelmed with several options, which makes finding the right candidate challenging. Although it also means, if you don&rsquo;t get someone to agree on your rate, you can always move on and consider another person.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More so, if a freelance developer delays their services, shows incomprehension, or an unprofessional ground., you can always cancel their contract. In some cases, you can even ask for a refund.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>They are the EXPERTS:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why in capitals, you ask?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To show emphasis, or rather their importance. Freelance developers are often former employees of a famous software development company backed by reliable experience. These folks are quite knowledgeable in their domain and have the skills that make them the master of software development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Flexibility is not a given:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have an issue that needs urgent resolution?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or, want a developer to fix a bug outside of working hours?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You might not get your in-house employees to do it, but you can certainly get it done by a freelancer. They&rsquo;re available back and forth at your call any time during the day, including the odd hours.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Disadvantages of hiring freelance developers&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quite possibly, the above advantages might have given you the feeling: Freelancers are the best!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But wait before you come to that conclusion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like two sides of a coin, choosing a freelancer over a <a href=\"https://triazinesoft.com/\">custom software development company</a> has its cons.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Might disappear:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is your freelancer not picking up your calls or replying to your emails?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you hand over all your private information to the wrong person?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goosebumps, right!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While not every freelancer does it, but some do! That&rsquo;s your bad luck that you encountered one amongst the bunch.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep a Plan B always handy, just in case. Conversely, keep some options open as a reserve.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Quality of work:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not all hired freelancers have the same working demeanor and reputation. Some professionals don&rsquo;t invest time in software coding and pass on the project to someone else. It creates a nuisance for you, making it tedious to find one person capable enough for the job. More so, reputation degradation doesn&rsquo;t matter to freelancers since there is always an option to create a new account or work anonymously.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sharing confidential information with a stranger:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unless you ask them to sign a non-disclosure agreement, freelancers are always a risk to your privacy and security. Therefore, it is intelligent to sign contracts before allotting them your confidential KTs. Don&rsquo;t make your business vulnerable to data leakage, conspiracy, or private information stealing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sans Maintenance and Support:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the software developer codes the project., they do not indulge in in-app or website maintenance or support. Since such freelancers do not provide post-development services, you might have to find another developer to fix bugs and offer support occasionally.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what do you do then?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Start the entire process from scratch, hire a software development company and do it all again.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Missing deadlines:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes, freelancers do not have the necessary organizational skills required. They might ask for additional time and miss deadlines or misunderstand the central idea of the project. It weakens the foundation of your software project, leading to unworthy product development. Moreover, since they have several clients to please, they might not even heed your concerns.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Freelance VS Custom Software Development Company: Is the Latter a better option?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"#\" src=\"https://www.triazinesoft.com/admin/assets/images/postsDesc/pricing_blog.png\" style=\"height:430px; width:870px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"https://triazinesoft.com/\">custom software development company</a> has everything you&rsquo;re looking for: qualified professionals, 24*7 maintenance and support, assured results, necessary experience, and expertise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But wait!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are your concerns?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their hiring cost!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For companies looking for similar services, a software development firm ensures security, privacy, and trustworthiness. Their team encompasses professionals belonging to several domains: developers for mobiles/websites, product testers, product managers, content makers, designers, analysts, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Advantages of hiring a software development firm</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building a new software requires coding, experienced professionals, and several other characteristics. That is why you must consider a custom software development firm, and if you&rsquo;re still not sure, then the following benefits will win you over.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The product development stage consists of monitoring, analysis, and customization.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Expertise. Experience. Efficiency:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A software development company not only has the knack for coding exceptionally reliable software solutions but is proficient in handling varied project requirements. From simple websites to web apps and products for large corporations, they can do it all. Moreover, since the developers hired by the company have a versatile coding background., there are fewer to no errors. Also, they acquire an entire team of developers, designers, managers, QAs, etc., to bring a futuristic product to reality. They can work on your product, advise improvements, solve bottlenecks, and find appropriate paths.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>All-in-one package:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A software development company not only develops your product but offers a whole cycle of services like consulting, bug fixing, maintenance, and marketing strategies. For startups or budding entrepreneurs who don&rsquo;t have the necessary skills or knowledge to ace every step of the app development process., it is a blessing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Strict on deadlines:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professionalism: it differentiates the approach of a company from the other. Throughout the development process, you receive updates and progress reports. Furthermore, you can even monitor the work done, connect with the project manager in case of any discrepancy, ask for necessary refinements, receive a product that caters to your demands.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since these companies care too much about their reputation, they ensure responsibility while meeting deadlines. Such companies bring stability to your IT infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reputation management and customer care support:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For an aspiring software development firm, there is nothing more important than their reputation. They take care of their clients because they prize their relationship with them. In the process, they earn a lot of positive feedbacks, and their reputation grows. And that is how their customer base expands.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happy customers will get you more clients. And unhappy ones will make you lose prospective ones.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So qualified companies make it a point to forge long-term bonds with their clients to upsell their sales. Therefore, they offer maintenance and support services for new/existing products, fix issues, modify functionality, and more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Disadvantages of hiring a Software Development Company</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hiring a software development firm is associated with some challenges too.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, let&rsquo;s review the cons associated with hiring a software development company against a freelancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>High priced:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While a software development firm might ask for higher rates than a freelance developer, they offer brilliant results. It is one reason why companies incline towards freelancers than any software development consulting firm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While deciding who to pick, you must decipher the quality of a software product into consideration. You should never accept a bid only because it includes lower rates. Look for the best cost and quality ratio, and then go for the project you want.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Communication issues:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes, when you hire a software development company, communication issues might happen. The outsourced company might belong to another country, different time zones, language barriers, geographical restrictions, and several others. The only way you can get out of such situations is by putting an experienced Business Analyst or Project Manager in both locations to ensure smooth execution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Often, you would like to know the exact staff working on the project:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a freelancer, you know the person working on the project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the reciprocation might be entirely different in the case of a custom software development company. When you hire a development team, you don&rsquo;t know who exactly is working on the app. Top software development companies set up a kick-off meeting to introduce all the team members employed on the project, but not all practice such propositions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Such collaborations are easier said than done:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Managing two different teams, making them comply with each other, and ensure a smooth project running is not that simple. Your IT department must accommodate their needs and demands. Besides, they should work through complexities and ensure a fruitful collaboration. And then, several technical glitches might hamper project delivery. Such conditionalities does affect the viability of your partnership.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Freelance VS Software Development Company: Which one to choose?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"#\" src=\"https://www.triazinesoft.com/admin/assets/images/postsDesc/pricing_blog2.png\" style=\"height:430px; width:870px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no right answer to this question.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you choose a freelancer or a software development company., it depends on your requirements and the project. True that freelance development fits today&rsquo;s modern and dynamic market, but concerns like uncertain workflows and questionable freedom prevail. Both outsourcing have their importance, and the one you choose should better your company&rsquo;s operations. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider their varied experience and state-of-the-art solutions.

Definitely, it is on a consistent boom. But that alone cannot detail the tens of thousands of mobile apps on the Play Store and the App Store.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Majority people rely, depend, and require an app for minor chores., spending an excessive amount of time on it. That said, mobile apps have become a quintessential part of our lives, and we cannot live a day without them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"3.2 billion smartphone users\" src=\"https://www.triazinesoft.com/admin/assets/images/postsDesc/billion-smartphone-users.png\" style=\"height:430px; width:870px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>More so, with the magnanimous&nbsp;3.2 billion smartphone users, it is no wonder that mobile apps will be a trend in the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, before we head into a functional pricing strategy for&nbsp;<strong>a&nbsp;</strong><strong><a href=\"https://triazinesoft.com/\">mobile app development</a>&nbsp;</strong><strong>company</strong>, let&rsquo;s understand why mobile apps are such a big deal!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What do Mobile Apps matter?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you ever wonder what drives a user to use or download an app?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mobile apps are valuable to consumers for a variety of reasons. It might be because they solve a particular problem or because they add convenience to their routine. If statistics are believable enough, a person checks their phone every 12 minutes. Moreover, 10% of people check their phones every four minutes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We use phones, tablets, laptops, and all the other devices while we&rsquo;re eating, in bed, or maybe even in our cars. Even so, you might be reading this article through an app. That is why people spent 88% of the mobile time on apps.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no one reason why&nbsp;<strong>mobile application development</strong>&nbsp;matters today, but a solid compilation of several features.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, all these features might interest you to own an app or develop one, but there is one thing you must know: 9999 in 10000 apps fail to make it even remotely big in the market.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An app should solve a user&rsquo;s problem, provide them with a comfortable solution, integrate with modern technology, and ensure information privacy and safety.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Mobile time spent on apps\" src=\"https://www.triazinesoft.com/admin/assets/images/postsDesc/mobile-time-spent-on-apps.png\" style=\"height:430px; width:870px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>True: mobile apps do matter, but if you don&rsquo;t know how to set your claim and compete in this multi-billion-dollar industry, you will not survive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is a mobile app development pricing strategy?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Pricing strategy for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://triazinesoft.com/\">mobile app development</a> refers to the way you make money from an application. Every app has a business model backbone. And, it is human to think of making money from an application. Initially, you might launch your app as a minimum viable product, but having a pricing strategy secures its lifecycle and robustness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, it might seem that pricing an app is a simple process., it is not!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding the user psychology and behavior towards an app price is not easy to master. Once you know how your users will respond to a particular pricing strategy, your apps will make their way into the consumer alleys. And if you aren&rsquo;t able to price the app, you can always hire a mobile application development company for their incredible experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, with the changing dynamics of the App Store&rsquo;s pricing models, evaluating the price of modern apps is very different from the erstwhile strategies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, today, there are four different pricing methods: free, freemium, paid, and paymium.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The types of pricing strategies for Mobile App Development Company</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned before, there are four different types of mobile app pricing strategies. These include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Free:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who doesn&rsquo;t like free apps!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since users do not get premium features of an app free these days, it is always a pleasant experience when an entire application is labeled free.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The free model works fine if you want to attract several customers to your app, but then., how will you make money out of it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, if you list your app as free, then earning bucks should not be your only goal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, there are two types of free pricing strategies:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Completely free</strong>: These apps are not money-makers but serve as an addition to an already established product.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what does this app do?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It actually drives people to other revenue streams.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, your app can educate people about the coupons or discounts on your website, intriguing them to that side of your online road.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some examples of such apps include banking services, mobile wallet apps, or customer service apps. Such&nbsp;<a href=\"https://triazinesoft.com/\">mobile app development</a><strong> </strong>services&nbsp;concentrate on informing about additional offers or any new credit card scheme. These services make money at the bank even if the app doesn&rsquo;t come at a price tag.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In-app advertisements:</strong>&nbsp;Such apps use their platform for ads and make money out of it. Advertisers can rent a space on the app, and people see those apps. But, these apps are still free to download and use. Examples include gaming apps that display too many third-party apps on their interface.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Pricing Strategies\" src=\"https://www.triazinesoft.com/admin/assets/images/postsDesc/pricing-strategies.png\" style=\"height:430px; width:870px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Advantages:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>The free model works perfect if you want several customers on your platform while increasing retention numbers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>It is good to establish a brand image.&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>The app drags several downloads.&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>In-app advertisements generate good money.&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>The money earned correlates to the download numbers. So, ensure a multitude of downloads to make good money.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Your customers might not like apps stuffed with too many ads.&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Freemium:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A freemium pricing model resembles a free and paid pricing strategy. There are some features available for free and for the others, you&rsquo;ll have to pay. Mostly the premium features need extra pay.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, there are three main types of freemium apps:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>The app offers basic features and functionalities for free, whereas you must pay to continue using it.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>The app is free but contains ads, and you might have to pay a one-time fee to have the ads removed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>You can download the app for free, but if you want to move up the ladder and access premium features, you might need to spend money or use the in-app currency. This form is popular with gaming apps.&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Attract several users and organic traffic&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Users can pay for specific features when they&rsquo;re willing to do it&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Too many downloads&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Proper management of updates is necessary&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Lack of premium features might irritate users, result in bad reviews, and decrease customer retention.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Paid:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In simple words, people pay once to download the app, and then it&rsquo;s free to use. App prices might be easily affordable or not! Once they pay, you can use all the features in it. These apps do come with rich features that make up for the spend. Since it is price-based, the <a href=\"https://triazinesoft.com/\">mobile app development</a> for such apps should be top-notch to attract larger crowds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>The apps come with reliable features hooking up users for a lifetime</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>These apps add comfort and convenience to a user&rsquo;s schedule</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>It builds up a loyal population&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>A solid revenue system&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Massive user group with top ratings&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>The concept of the app matters to its reputation, engagement, and downloads&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>There are high user expectations from the app&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>The <a href=\"https://triazinesoft.com/\">mobile app development</a> paper cost of these apps is exceedingly high&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>The time to build these is also high&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>There is no certainty that the app will generate revenue or attract users&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Paymium:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This model is a blend of paid and freemium versions. The users pay for the app before downloading, but additional features come at an additional cost. If people love your app, they will pay for premium features.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One such example is Heads Up. This paymium app draws people due to its less than a dollar downloading price, but you only get fixed card categories to play. To access the dozens more, you can purchase from within the app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For <a href=\"https://triazinesoft.com/\">mobile app development</a> companies investing in such apps., you need to give value to it through its content. Showcase not the benefits of the app but also how valuable it is. The app&rsquo;s leverage comes from great marketing and a strong reputation. Also, have a rewarding revenue strategy in place for such mobile app development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>A consistent payment portal</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>A creative out-of-the-box idea to attract more users&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Compilation of loyal and committed users&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>There is a smaller number of downloads&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Appealing content and excellent features required&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>A time-consuming effort is mandatory&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Meet user&rsquo;s expectations&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Which pricing strategy to choose?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is probably the most tedious part of <a href=\"https://triazinesoft.com/\">mobile app development</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"#\" src=\"https://www.triazinesoft.com/admin/assets/images/postsDesc/what_pricing_.png\" style=\"height:430px; width:870px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly, you want your app to do big things in the market, gain revenue, improve brand reputation, make the <a href=\"https://triazinesoft.com/\">mobile app development</a> company known.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, you keep asking yourself this one question:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which is the best approach for your app?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which pricing strategy should you pick?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think about apps as any other product. The right price is the one that customers are willing to pay.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that is not your only challenge?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You obviously want users to surf the app today, tomorrow, and the next week. They must keep going back to the app. And that is what you need to master.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wrong price tag on the app could be a potential turn off for your users.

And then there was a tedious browser war, wherein developers brainstormed how to optimize the Chrome browser. This brainstorming led to removing CSS from the browser engine, and to their surprise, it spiked performance levels.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Realizing the potential of a&nbsp;<strong>cross-platform mobile app development</strong>&nbsp;browser, developers focused on bringing this notion to reality. And this led to Google presenting their first such product, Flutter, to the market.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This guide covers Flutter&#39;s necessary information, its benefits, and how to use it to build incredible apps within a short time. Altogether, you&#39;ll get a view of how Flutter is the right solution for your <strong>mobile application development company</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.triazinesoft.com/admin/assets/images/postsDesc/flutter_img.png\" style=\"height:461px; width:937px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Much-Needed Mobile App Development Platform: Flutter&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wondering whether Flutter is the right platform for your next&nbsp;<strong>mobile app development</strong>&nbsp;project and whether your business will gain something out of it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of whether you&#39;re a CEO, CTO, or a technical lead, you&rsquo;ll find Flutter blessed with benefits that elevate performance and decrease project delivery time. More so, it invites developers to incorporate modern technologies into their applications.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what is Flutter?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For every new&nbsp;<strong>mobile app development</strong>&nbsp;project, developers face the challenge of choosing what instrument to use and what platform to choose. True that every project is different, but there is one thing uniting them: the resulting app must run on as many devices and platforms as possible. Before Flutter, developers tediously build prototypes for different app platforms, which, to be honest, was very frustrating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that is why Flutter was a game-changer in the&nbsp;<strong>mobile application development</strong>&nbsp;arenas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Introduced by Google in December 2018, Flutter is an open-source technology used for coding and building native apps for Android and iOS. It is a&nbsp;<strong>cross-platform mobile app development</strong>&nbsp;platform that allows coding apps for mobile, web, and desktop effortless and easy, through a single codebase.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although it is relatively new in the&nbsp;<strong>mobile app development</strong>&nbsp;world; it is highly recognized and known worldwide.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flutter simplifies coding while adjusting to the visual consistency of an app between platforms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its programming language, Dart, was initially thought of as a replacement to JavaScript.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its open-source and free nature make it equally popular with React Native on GitHub and Stack Overflow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, Google employs Flutter for its Assistant modules and Google Home user interface. More so, there are more than 50,000 Flutter apps available on Google Play Store, and this value is heavily increasing. Even popular e-commerce channels like the Alibaba Group, eBay, Groupon, etc., use Flutter to give their web, mobile, and desktop apps a unique and uniform look.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpcjBD1XDwU&amp;list=PLOU2XLYxmsILq4ysYNWXq5TOGLgYDJgVD&amp;index=3\">Tim Sneath, Group Product Manager at Google</a>, Flutter is the result of developers dreaming about a powerful, general-purpose, and open UI toolkit to build incredible application experiences on the web, desktop, mobile, and beyond.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Do you need a cross-platform mobile app development platform?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Flutter came into existence,&nbsp;<strong>cross-development mobile app development</strong>&nbsp;platforms had an unworthy reputation: coding issues, slow performance, and too much maintenance. Developers said the cross-platform platform lacked native capabilities to access the coding device&#39;s microphone, camera, and geolocation services.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While a&nbsp;<strong>mobile app development</strong>&nbsp;company was skeptical whether to invest in cross-platform development or not, Google introduced Flutter as the gleaming product for such prospects. More so, Flutter is faster than your common development platform, is superbly cost-effective, and solves a crucial need in the market: coding mobile apps for several platforms with a singular codebase.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Is Flutter worth my next mobile app development project?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"#\" src=\"https://www.triazinesoft.com/admin/assets/images/postsDesc/flutter_blog.png\" style=\"height:430px; width:870px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Answering the question you landed on this blog for, is Flutter a considerable choice for your mobile application development project?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, right there are Flutter competitors to consider, and every&nbsp;<strong>cross-development mobile app development&nbsp;</strong>platform has some unique features; the former is way better than the latter options.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, let&#39;s take a close look at what makes Flutter better than other frameworks. And then you&#39;ll be able to decide whether you should or should not choose Flutter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Same logic and UI for every platform&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Mobile app development service experts have known that every cross-platform framework has a way to share the codebase between target platforms. However, except Flutter, there is no other cross-platform framework that allows developers to share the UI code and the UI.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To illustrate it better, let&#39;s consider the following example.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is how the UI rendering process allows features to stay compatible in every platform. However, UI rendering of platform-specific components requires property mapping for platform widgets and widget data synchronization. That means a developer has to map every animation into a platform-specific device. Complicated: isn&#39;t it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coming back to Flutter, you don&#39;t need any platform-specific UI components for UI rendering. Instead, the application UI only needs a canvas to draw from Flutter. It makes your framework standout, and you don&#39;t have to worry about maintaining consistency and performance on different platforms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It saves time, effort, and the mental sanity of a developer!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Reduce coding time:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"#\" src=\"https://www.triazinesoft.com/admin/assets/images/postsDesc/flutter_blog1.png\" style=\"height:430px; width:870px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developers would agree that shipping an Android app onto a test device takes so much time. And sometimes, changing a small visual aspect in a layout can take so many days. Before you bring Android Studio&#39;s preview layout into this discussion, let us tell you the feature is limited and doesn&#39;t always work well as expected, especially when it comes to custom views.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And this is where Flutter&#39;s hot reload feature comes into the picture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It allows you to see changes made instantaneously without losing its refined application look. It is why Flutter is the perfect choice for a mobile app development company since it has a blazingly fast development speed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has several ready-to-use widgets in its framework, which are easy to customize and saves a lot of development time. Its creative core layout widgets make it better than any other cross-platform mobile app development framework. All in all, it makes the mobile app development process more straightforward, hassle-free, and less worrisome.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Faster time-to-market speed:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once and for all, Flutter&#39;s development framework is incredibly faster than its alternatives. Developing an app using Flutter is 2X times faster than that of iOS and&nbsp;<strong>Android app development</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why so?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s dead simple: you don&#39;t have to write platform-specific code but a single codebase that&#39;ll adjust its visuals for different app frameworks. You can add 2D-based specific UI in Flutter without disturbing its native counterpart.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More so, Flutter&#39;s API for UI building boosts your app&#39;s performance. When it comes to visual adjustments, nothing beats the changing layout speed of Flutter. Subsequently, it improves your app&#39;s performance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Better than the Native app Performance:&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We all know how crucial an app&#39;s UI is for its end performance. While there is no end cap on how better Flutter&#39;s app performance is; however, it is for sure better than a native app and even better during complex UI animation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike its other cross-platform frameworks, Flutter does not need an intermediate code representation or an interpretation. Its code is directly built into machine code, eliminating any performance bugs encountered during the interpretation process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In time, you&#39;ll release an application compiled for modern speed and needs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Customize anything and everything:&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest reasons mobile app development companies prefer using Flutter is its innate customization ability for any UI, irrespective of its complexity. While you can customize UI for other native platforms, the time required differs by a colossal magnitude.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flutter, however, makes the entire UI customization process versatile and flexible to your needs. Be it shared element transition, color changes, shadow manipulations, and shape changes, Flutter can do anything and everything for you in the least possible time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>It has its rendering engine:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Flutter&#39;s rendering engine Skia helps code apps that look incredible and feels smooth. It is a robust cross-platform mobile app development framework that allows you to adjust the UI and transfer it to another platform, simplifying the development process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Platform-specific logic:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Other than the UI, several other app components require advanced logic. For example, GPS coordinates, Bluetooth communication, accumulating sensor data, permission handling, storing app credentials, etc. Several of these are already available to a developer, thanks to Flutter&#39;s ready-to-use plugins.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, of course, there might be features not available as a Flutter plugin, but don&#39;t worry! You&#39;re covered here as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flutter eases the communication between a platform-specific code and Dart via platform channels. This way, you can get so much with your Flutter app than any native app framework.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Not limited by web, desktop, and mobile but beyond:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With Flutter, you don&#39;t just focus on mobile app development but beyond. You can employ Flutter for the web or Flutter for Desktop as well. And since it&#39;s a Google product, you can expect several other noteworthy updates in the future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, Google presented Flutter Web&#39;s technical preview and how it makes it possible to run Flutter apps in a web browser without requiring any source-code modification.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such innovations in mobile application development mark it different from any other cross-platform mobile app development platform. With Flutter, a mobile app development company has a robust cross-platform development tool within its reach.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More so, an experienced Flutter developer can run a Flutter app on any platform: Android, iOS, Browser, Windows, macOS, Linux, and other embedded devices. Thanks to its Dart code, you don&#39;t have to stress about app performance and user experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Does Flutter have any cons?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>True that Flutter is quite versatile in mobile app development; it still isn&#39;t immune to limitations. A mobile app development company might face some restrictions while employing its general-purpose and open-source solutions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Impressive but not rich libraries and support&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Google framework for Flutter is incredible. It consists of several helpful libraries and functionalities that are ready-for-use. However, you might not find all features you&#39;re looking for. It means, sometimes, a developer might need to build some functionalities, which is a rather time-consuming process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Flutter evolves rapidly, and Google will fix most of these issues by the time you think of incorporating them into your mobile app development process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Not widely supported by continuous integration platforms:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As of now, several CI platforms like Travis and Jenkins do not support Flutter. Therefore, automatic building, testing, and deployment require custom script maintenance. However, knowing Google, Flutter will undergo some rapid transformations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, Google announced a new CI/CD platform called Codemagic in 2018. More so, Bitrise declared its full-featured support to the Flutter CI.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>React Native better in some prospects:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If a mobile app development company needs a prototype or a single-page application, React Native is a better solution than Flutter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nNot a proud choice for high-load apps:</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Flutter apps are known for outstanding performances; however, if you want to code a high-load app to stream trade data or incorporate an AI component, Flutter or React Native aren&#39;t the best choices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Is Flutter the right choice from a mobile app development company&#39;s perspective?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a mobile app development company, you only want to invest in platforms that add value to the process. Flutter&#39;s exceptional stability during cross-development, ever-growing UI tools, and lightspeed performance guarantees improvement and enriching customer experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suppose you&#39;re considering Flutter for your next mobile application development project; it&#39;s worth it. Flutter lowers risks and complications as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Seamless product development is in the future since Google is working on Fuchsia OS that amalgamates perfectly with Flutter.</li>\r\n	<li>There is a vast pool of developers using Flutter for mobile app development.
